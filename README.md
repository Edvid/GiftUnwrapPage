# GiftUnwrapPage

This is a tiny little website that you can use, if you want to share an image digitally as a gift for someone, but still want it to feel like they're unwrapping the image rather than being sent it via a chat program.

The URL to share with your friend will be the url bellow, with the [] part replaced by somewhere that image is hosted digitally.

`https://edvid.github.io/GiftUnwrapPage/?img=`[]

 You could share the image with yourself on your favourite chat program, use imgur, or some other service, as long as the image is reachable by anyone regardless of log in info on such platforms.
 A quick way to test if your URL will work for this program, is to paste the url into the URL bar of a private/incognito window of your browser.
